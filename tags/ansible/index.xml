      <description>Intro I have set up a NAT instance using amazonLinux2. I utilized Packer and Ansible for the configuration process.
Set up a NAT instance using amazonLinux2. Explain why amazonLinux2 is chosen: Lambda does not support incoming connections initiated externally, so it does not support FTP in active mode. ECS does not allow for the static allocation of private IP addresses. While it is possible to achieve static allocation by combining it with NAT Private Gateway, since it is a gateway type, it cannot accept incoming connections from external sources.</description>
